The scanner view page needs a redesign.

The mechanics of zero-conf scanning and matching, okay.


The overall purpose of this page is the following:
It is to search for or configure manually a preferred broker to test whether that broker can be connected to and save that information for the next AppRestart or Background-Forground interaction.

A preferred broker can be said in three different ways.

First, a pre-configured broker from a list which are called manual, like test.mosquit.org.
Second, they can be auto-discovered by an mDNS scan.
Third, they can be manually configured by providing an IP address or hostname, a port number, a method like ws or wss,
And whether to use TLS certificate verification at startup.

If the broker is auto-discovered, it might need additional attributes like username, port number and TLS certificate variation, yes or no.

This is not the case for pre-configured brokers like test.mosquito.org.

In the case of a manually configured broker, of which there can be only one, it needs hostname or IP address, port number, service type, meaning WS or WSS, TLS certificate verification, and optionally username and password.

If a preferred broker is set, there shall be a way to connect to it and post a test message and verify that this is successful.

Suggestion, this could be a button like test Test connect, leading to the MQTTclientview page Where a user can connect to and disconnect to this broker, verify that it works, post messages to it and see the last 10 messages being received by subscribing to the SHARP.
Topic. The test connect button heads over to the MQTT client view page and the back button there returns to the scanner view page. . .

If a preferred broker is set, it shall be It's stored in a persistent reference, so it is reloaded on startup.

If the test push succeeds, then the broker entry should be marked as valid, meaning it should be auto-connected on app startup or leaving the configuration page.

If the preferred broker is set and the test was successful on leaving the scanner view page, it shall be connected to.

The scannerview page should have a visual indication that the broker is, to indicate the broker's State , like a colored icon

The broker itself should go through the following states:
disconnected, trying, connected,


Provide options for any unclear problems.
Do not jump to conclusions. Don't hesitate to ask.

Make sure the user interface is usable on mobiles, meaning compact and mostly single. We do not expect more than like five broker entries and ideally they should fit in a single page in a mobile view.
Do not take the scanner view page layout as granted, rather revamp it such that it is best for this new plan.
